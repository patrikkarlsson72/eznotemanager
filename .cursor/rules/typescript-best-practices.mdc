- Use strict null checks to prevent null or undefined errors

- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes

- Use type guards and assertions for runtime type checking

- Implement proper type inference to reduce unnecessary type annotations

- Use enums for a fixed set of constants and union types for extensible sets
