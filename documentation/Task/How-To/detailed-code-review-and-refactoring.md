# Detailed Task: Code Review and Refactoring

## Objective
Conduct a thorough code review to identify areas for improvement and refactor code for better readability and maintainability.

## Steps

### 1. Code Review
- **Set Up a Review Process**: Use tools like GitHub or GitLab for code reviews. Ensure all team members are familiar with the process.
- **Identify Key Areas**: Focus on areas with complex logic, repeated patterns, or known issues.
- **Use Linters and Formatters**: Run ESLint and Prettier to catch syntax errors and enforce code style.

### 2. Refactoring
- **Simplify Logic**: Break down complex functions into smaller, reusable components.
- **Use React Hooks**: Replace class components with functional components using hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.
- **Optimize Context Usage**: Ensure context is used efficiently to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

### 3. Documentation
- **Comment Code**: Add comments to explain complex logic or decisions.
- **Update Documentation**: Reflect changes in the codebase in your documentation files.

### Tools and Resources
- **Code Review Tools**: GitHub, GitLab
- **Linters**: ESLint
